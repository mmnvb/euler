A $4 \times 4$ grid is filled with digits $d$, $0 \le d \le 9$.
It can be seen that in the grid
\begin{matrix}
6 & 3 & 3 & 0\\
5 & 0 & 4 & 3\\
0 & 7 & 1 & 4\\
1 & 2 & 4 & 5
\end{matrix}
the sum of each row and each column has the value $12$. Moreover the sum of each diagonal is also $12$.
In how many ways can you fill a $4 \times 4$ grid with the digits $d$, $0 \le d \le 9$ so that each row, each column, and both diagonals have the same sum?
