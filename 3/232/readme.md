Two players share an unbiased coin and take it in turns to play The Race.
On Player 1's turn, the coin is tossed once. If it comes up Heads, then Player 1 scores one point; if it comes up Tails, then no points are scored.
On Player 2's turn, a positive integer, $T$, is chosen by Player 2 and the coin is tossed $T$ times. If it comes up all Heads, then Player 2 scores $2^{T-1}$ points; otherwise, no points are scored.

Player 2 will always selects the number, $T$, of coin tosses that maximises the probability of winning.
